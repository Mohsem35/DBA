### PostgreSQL technical questions

_Q1. What is PostgreSQL?_

PostgreSQL, commonly referred to as Postgres, **powers applications with its robust and open-source relational database management system**. Developers leverage its extensive features, such as **Function Overloading** and **Table Inheritance**, to create advanced applications. PostgreSQL seamlessly operates across major operating systems, including Windows, UNIX, macOS, and Linux.


_Q2. What are the advantages of PostgreSQL?_

The advantages of PostgreSQL include:

1. PostgreSQL is **highly fault-tolerant**, owing to its **feature of write-ahead logging**.
2. It is flexible and easy to learn.
3. It supports a **variety of replication methods**.
4. It can be **used for large-scale web applications** because of its **powerful and robust** nature.
5. As the source code of PostgreSQL is available for free due to its open-source license, users can edit and modify it easily according to their business requirements.

_Q3. Define a non-clustered index_

In PostgreSQL, a non-clustered index is like an **index at the back of a book**. It tells you **where to find information** without actually rearranging the book itself. Here are some key points:

In a non-clustered index, the **order of the index rows differs from the physical order of the real data**. The leaf pages of a non-clustered index instead **contain pointers to the real data** rather than the actual data itself. Its main advantage is that it provides faster access to data.

To create a non-clustered index in PostgreSQL, you typically use the `CREATE INDEX` statement, specifying the columns to be indexed and optionally additional parameters for customization such as index name, uniqueness, and index type. Here's a basic example:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_name ON table_name (column1, column2);
```
This statement creates a non-clustered index named `idx_name` on `table_name` for the columns "column1" and "column2".

They are useful for **speeding up read operations like `SELECT` queries** because they provide a shortcut to finding the rows you're interested in. However, they can introduce some **overhead during write operations** (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) because changes to the table data might require updates to the index as well.

You can create **multiple non-clustered indexes on a single table**, each targeting different columns or combinations of columns


_Q4. Which data types are used in PostgreSQL?_

The following data types are used in PostgreSQL:-

- Numeric data type (Integer, Float)
- Geometric primitives
- Boolean data type
- Character data type (varchar, char, text)
- Monetary data type
- Array
- Document data type (JSON, XML, Key-value, etc.)
- Date/Time data type
- Customization data type (Composite, custom types, etc.)

_Q5. What do you mean by a parallel query?_

Parallel query in PostgreSQL is **an advanced feature**. It allows the arrangement of **query plans** in such a way that they can **exploit multiple CPUs**. This helps in **answering user queries** in a much faster and quicker manner.  


_Q6. What is the meaning of PgAdmin?_

PgAdmin is a free open-source **graphical front-end** PostgreSQL database administration tool. This web-based GUI tool is prominently used to manage PostgreSQL databases. It assists in **monitoring and managing numerous complex PostgreSQL** and EDB database systems. PgAdmin is used to accomplish tasks like **accessing**, **developing**, and **carrying out quality testing procedures**.


_Q7. Define Write-Ahead logging_

Write-Ahead Logging is a technique used to **ensure the data integrity of PostgreSQL databases**. It helps in maintaining the resilience or the reliability of the database. Write-ahead logging is a method wherein **any changes and actions** in the database are **logged in a transaction log prior** to the updating or modification of the database. In case there is a **database crash**, this feature helps the in **providing the log of the database changes**. In addition, it also helps the user in resuming work from where it was discontinued, after the crash.

_Q8. What is the full form of MVCC?_

The full form of MVCC is Multi-version Concurrency Control.

_Q9. Why do companies use PostgreSQL?_

Numerous high-profile organizations, such as **Apple**, **Spotify**, **IMDb**, **Instagram**, and **Skype**, make use PostgreSQL database, owing to its excellent features:

- PostgreSQL is extremely easy to use.
- It is a powerful and robust open-source tool.
- PostgreSQL **follows and supports the ACID properties**.
- It **supports MVCC**(Multiversion Concurrency Control).
- It is highly **fault-tolerant**.
- It **runs on almost all different operating systems**.

_Q10. What is the full form of GEQO?_

The full form of GEQO is **Genetic Query Optimization**. It enables non-exhaustive search to efficiently manage **large join queries** in PostgreSQL.

It is an optional **query optimization technique** used by the PostgreSQL query planner. GEQO **uses genetic algorithms** to explore various query plans and attempt to **find an optimal or near-optimal execution plan for complex queries**.

_Q11. What do you mean by index in PostgreSQL?_

An index in PostgreSQL is a way of increasing the **speed and efficiency** of the database. Databases use indexes as **special lookup tables** that help them **retrieve data in a much quicker manner**. Indexes enable the user to **find specific rows** in a database. They **act like pointers** to the data in the database, thereby **enhancing the overall performance**.

_Q12. What is the main query language of PostgreSQL?_

SQL or Structured Query Language is the main query language of PostgreSQL.

_Q13. What is the full form of ORDBMS?_

The full form of ORDBMS is **Object-Relational Database Management System**.

_Q14. What do you mean by a string constant in PostgreSQL?_

A string constant is defined as the **sequence of characters that are bounded by single quotes** i.e., (‘). It can be **used during insertion or while passing the characters to the database objects**. This is an **important feature** when performing the **parsing of data**. In the case of PostgreSQL, string constant is allowed with single quotes but embedded by a **C-style backslash**.

Example: ‘This is an example of a string constant bound by single quotes.’

**Single Quotes vs. Double Quotes**: PostgreSQL allows string constants to be enclosed within either single quotes or double quotes. Both single and double quotes can be used interchangeably to represent string literals. However, when **using double quotes**, the **string is treated as an identifier** rather than a literal constant.

```sql
-- Single quotes
SELECT 'Hello, World!';

-- Double quotes (treated as an identifier)
SELECT "column_name" FROM table_name;

-- String with escape sequences
SELECT 'Line 1\nLine 2';

-- Concatenation of string constants
SELECT 'Hello, ' || 'World!';
```

_Q15. What is Multi-version Control?_

Multi-version Concurrency Control or MVCC is a technique to enhance database performance by handling concurrency in PostgreSQL databases. It **prevents the locking of databases**. MVCC **reduces the delay time that users face while logging into their accounts** and comes into action when someone else is accessing the contents of the account.

**Inconsistency occurs when numerous transactions attempt to access the same data**. To preserve data consistency, concurrency control is necessary.

Let’s take an example of an ATM machine. **If concurrency is not applied** in this case, **different users won’t be able to access their accounts and draw money at the same time**. Whereas if concurrency control is enabled, then multiple users can do so easily.


_Q16. Explain table partitioning in PostgreSQL._

Table Partitioning in PostgreSQL is the **process** wherein a **large table is split into smaller pieces**. These **smaller pieces are known as partitions**. **`List`** and **`range`** partitioning is supported by PostgreSQL through its **table inheritance feature**.

Table partitioning **helps in increasing the query performance** of PostgreSQL, as it is much **easier to select data from partitions rather than selecting from one main table**.

Each partition can store data according to how frequently it is used, allowing **low-use data to be stored on media that may be slower or less expensive**.

_Q17. Explain the use of PostgreSQL triggers._

A trigger can be defined as a **function** that is **called automatically** when the **insertion, updation, or deletion event occurs**. They serve as a way to **check the data integrity**. Triggers are **capable of handling any errors that occur in the database**. Another advantage of triggers is: **Any table** that is present in a PostgreSQL database **can be forced to receive security approvals** with the use of PostgreSQL triggers.

_Q18. Is PostgreSQL compatible with Cloud?_

Yes, PostgreSQL is compatible and be run on Cloud. PostgreSQL is highly portable. Moreover, similar to other open-source databases, PostgreSQL can be effortlessly executed on virtual containers.

_Q19. Name the different types of operators that are used in PostgreSQL._

Operators are the special characters or words that are used mainly in the WHERE clause in PostgreSQL. These operators can be used to perform a variety of functions and operations.

_Q20. What do you mean by the CTID field in PostgreSQL?_


In PostgreSQL, the `ctid` field is a system column that represents the **physical location of a tuple within its table**. It is a **pseudo-column that exists for every row in a table** and is **automatically maintained by PostgreSQL**. The ctid value consists of two parts: the `1. block number` and the `2.tuple index` within that block.


In PostgreSQL, CTIDs serve as **unique identifiers** for each record within a table. The CTID field enables the **precise location of physical rows** based on their **offset and block positions**, facilitating the **effective distribution of data across the table**. By utilizing CTID fields, users can gain insights into the actual storage positions of rows within the database table.

```sql
SELECT ctid, column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE column1 = 'some_value';
```


_Q23. State the maximum size of a table on PostgreSQL._

The maximum number of blocks in a table decides the limit of the table. As the number of blocks is 2^32 and 8192 bytes is the default size of the block, therefore, the maximum size of a table on PostgreSQL is **32TB**.

_Q24. What are the differences between PostgreSQL and MongoDB?_
	


PostgreSQL  | MongoDB
------------- | -------------
PostgreSQL is a relational database management system  | MongoDB is a non-relational database management system
PostgreSQL was created using the C language  | MongoDB was created using the C++ language
PostgreSQL is object-oriented  | MongoDB is document-oriented
PostgreSQL stores data in the form of different tables | MongoDB stores data in the form of key-value pairs as one record
PostgreSQL is faster than MongoDB  | MongoDB is relatively slower than PostgreSQL


_Q25. State the role of tokens in PostgreSQL._

Tokens in PostgreSQL have an important role in the parsing and interpretation of SQL statements. **When SQL queries are executed**, the PostgreSQL server **breaks down the statements** into smaller units known as **tokens**. These tokens **represent various elements** like `keywords`, `identifiers`, `literals`, `operators`, and `punctuation marks`.  This tokenization process **ensures accurate parsing and evaluation of SQL queries**, enabling the server to handle database operations efficiently.


_Q26. When should a developer use PostgreSQL?_

Developers should choose PostgreSQL when they require a **dependable and feature-rich database** management system. PostgreSQL is suitable for diverse applications, including **web development**, **data analysis**, and **enterprise solutions**. It provides advanced features like **1.

- Put your server’s IP address in the “Hostname/Address” column to configure the connection.
- Finally, you must define “Port” as “5432,” which is the PostgreSQL server’s default port.

_Q29. Explain the role of table space in PostgreSQL._

Table spaces in PostgreSQL are defined as the **directories where data files can be stored**. They are used to **store various databases as well as database objects**.

Using table spaces, the **disk layout of a PostgreSQL** installation can be easily handled and managed.

In addition to that, tablespaces give administrators the ability to **enhance performance by making use of their knowledge of the usage patterns** of **database objects**.


_Q:30. List the disadvantages of PostgreSQL._
